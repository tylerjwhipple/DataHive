## About This Project

This project is a basic rough draft of a Desktop Application for searching and displaying app retirement data in a modern way. It is also meant to showcase the capabilities of [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and reusing components. It includes features like pagination, custom dropdowns, and displaying details. Further features such as exporting to Excel and PDF are coming in the near future.

## Further help

1. Clicking on The "Search Patients" Button provides all available sample patients in the database at this time for testing purposes.
2. When Selecting a Section, The Visit Section does not have a details component when the row result is clicked. However, a Clinicial Information row does. When a row is clicked, a pop-over will be displayed with the relevant information.
